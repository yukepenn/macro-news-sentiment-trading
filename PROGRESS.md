# Project Progress

## Current Status
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Basic README and documentation
- [x] Data fetching scripts for GDELT and market data
- [x] Initial data processing pipeline
- [x] Sentiment analysis implementation
- [x] Feature engineering
- [x] Model development
- [ ] Backtesting framework
- [ ] Performance evaluation
- [ ] Documentation and deployment

## Recent Updates
- Added threshold optimization to model tuning:
  - Implemented confidence-based trading thresholds
  - Added grid search for optimal upper/lower thresholds
  - Enhanced strategy evaluation with Sharpe ratio and turnover metrics
- Added new advanced features to feature engineering pipeline:
  - Goldstein momentum with multiple decay rates
  - Article count spike detection using z-scores
  - Smoothed sentiment using exponential weighted moving averages
  - New interaction features combining spikes and sentiment
- Updated GDELT data fetching to use BigQuery for better reliability and performance
- Added Google Cloud dependencies to requirements.txt
- Enhanced data processing pipeline with feature engineering
- sentiment_analysis.py now loads gdelt_macro_events_top20_with_headlines.csv and uses the 'headline' column for FinBERT sentiment analysis.
- Updated sentiment_analysis.py to move the model onto the GPU once and increased the default batch size to 64 for improved performance.

## Next Steps
1. Implement backtesting framework
2. Add performance evaluation metrics
3. Create visualization dashboard
4. Complete documentation
